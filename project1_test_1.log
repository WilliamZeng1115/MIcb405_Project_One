Variant convert to fasta by the python tool
vcf_x, exclude snp similar in all variants, since we are comparing to reference0 as a patient, we should use vcf, not vcf_x

Search: Normal +NNI +SPR (2 rounds range 10) +ML-NNI opt-each=1
TopHits: 1.00*sqrtN close=default refresh=0.80
ML Model: Jones-Taylor-Thorton, CAT approximation with 20 rate categories
WARNING! 100.0% NUCLEOTIDE CHARACTERS -- IS THIS REALLY A PROTEIN ALIGNMENT?

Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.765 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
